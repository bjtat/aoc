# Advent of Code Solutions

Contains my solutions organized by programming language.

## Running Solutions

### Go
```bash
cd go/2023
go run -tags day01 day01.go

# Or from anywhere in the repo:
go run -tags day01 go/2023/day01.go
```

**Note:** Build tags are required because all solutions are in the same directory. Each day has its own tag (e.g., `-tags day01`, `-tags day02`, etc.).

### Ruby
```bash
cd ruby/2024
ruby day01_part1.rb

# Or from anywhere in the repo:
ruby ruby/2024/day01_part1.rb
```
